A M.Tech project for recognizing Indian Sign Language using computer vision and deep learning.

A novel approach that enables efficient and precise sign language detection is the Real-Time Continuous Indian Sign Language detection system. This system utilizes YOLOv5 with Streamlit UI to detect static motions, alphabets, numerals, and dynamic gestures in real-time within video feeds by utilizing object detection capabilities.
